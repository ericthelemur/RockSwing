# Rock Swing
Quick Game/tech demo with grapple swinging and procedural rock textures. I made this in a day for University of Warwick's October 2020 Game Jam

Made with Processing, so almost all from scratch.

Rocks are procedural. I only started this Saturday afternoon, so not the full 48hrs. Only a single level atm unfortunately.

Controls:
    WASD to move
    Left click to shoot hook
    A/D to swing and W/S to climb rope

Unsurprisingly, the source code is messy, but I feel like someone might get some use out of it.

Update 18/11/20: Fixed missing bug with missing art and commented source code - slight bug fix in swinging code as well
